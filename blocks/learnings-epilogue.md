## Operational Self-Improvement

Before completing, reflect on this session:
- Did any commands fail unexpectedly?
- Did you take a wrong approach and have to backtrack?
- Did you discover a project-specific quirk (data format, GPU config, library version)?
- Did something take longer than expected because of a missing config or convention?

If yes, log an operational learning for future sessions. Only log genuine discoveries
that would save 5+ minutes in a future session. Don't log obvious things or transient errors.

There are two learnings files:

1. **Project learnings** (committed): `learnings.md` in the project root.
   Write here when the learning is about the project itself -- conventions,
   pitfalls, techniques, insights that any collaborator would benefit from.

2. **User learnings** (not committed): `~/.resskills/projects/{slug}/learnings.local.md`.
   Write here when the learning is about your local environment, personal
   preferences, or machine-specific quirks.

If unsure, default to project learnings. Most discoveries are project-level.

Append under the appropriate section in the chosen file. Create the file if it
doesn't exist.

```markdown
## Techniques
- [learning] (skill, YYYY-MM-DD)

## Pitfalls
- [learning] (skill, YYYY-MM-DD)

## Insights
- [learning] (skill, YYYY-MM-DD)

## Conventions
- [learning] (skill, YYYY-MM-DD)
```

If the file already exists, append to the matching section. If the section doesn't
exist, create it. Keep entries as one-line bullets.
